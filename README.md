Description
-----------

CoopSim is a computer program for simulating a game theoretic model of
cooperative behaviour that can be used in biology as well as social
sciences. The model is the reiterated pairwise prisoners dilemma that
has been made popular by Robert Axelrod and his book "The Evolution of
Cooperation". The reiterated pairwise prisoners dilemma can be
regarded as a formal description of some (but certainly not all!)
cooperation dilemmas.

CoopSim follows the description in Axelrods book. Different strategies
can be put against each other in a computer tournament. The user can
select the strategies, adjust game parameters and inspect the outcome
of single matches, the whole tournament and the ecological development
over a sequence of tournaments.
