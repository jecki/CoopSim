Description
-----------

PyPlotter is a Python package for plotting graphs and diagrams, which
I programmed when matplotlib did not yet exist. Because it is very
lightweight and fully compatible to jython (the java version of
python) it may still be of interest for some users today.

PyPlotter allows plotting on linear and logarithmic scales. Apart from
that it contains classes for plotting simplex diagrams, such as are
used in evolutionary game theory for example.

Through its own device driver PyPlotter can easily be adapted to
different graphical user interfaces or output devices. This means that
the same plotting subroutines can be used in a Jython applet in
conjunction with the Java AWT or in a standalone application utilizing
the wxWidgets, gtk or qt tookit.
